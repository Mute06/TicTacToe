### This is the Tic Tac Toe Game I made while learning React. 

You can play [here](https://Mute06.github.io/TicTacToe/)

#### Features
- Playable 3×3 board with X/O turns
- Winner detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection when the board fills with no winner
- Move history (time travel): jump back to any previous move
- Sort moves: toggle between Oldest First and Newest First
- Move annotations: each move shows the player and the (col,row) position played
- Winning squares highlighted when a player wins
